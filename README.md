# Scala-Examples

Its a Map-Reduce program that finds the connected components of any undirected graph and prints the size of these connected components. A connected component of a graph is a subgraph of the graph in which there is a path from any two vertices in the subgraph. For the above graph, there are two connected components: one 0,8,9 and another 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. This program should print the sizes of these connected components: 3 and 7.

Input: 
3,2,1
2,4,3
1,3,4,6
5,6
6,5,7,1
0,8,9
4,2,1
8,0
9,0
7,6


Output:
(0,3)
(1,7)
